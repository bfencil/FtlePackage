## Dense FTLE Computations in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$

### Overview

The dense FTLE codes differ from the sparse FTLE codes in that the initial particle positions are set on a uniform grid that spans the entire domain. This is opposed to the sparse FTLE codes where particles are placed arbitrarily in space.

This uniform grid structure is useful when:

- A global picture of the entire velocity field is desired.
- The velocity data itself is sparse but the user wants a continuous FTLE field.
- It simplifies the FTLE computation using finite-difference schemes.

The primary functions of interest for dense FTLE computations are:

- `FTLE_2d_dense` — for dense FTLE computation in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
- `FTLE_3d_dense` — for dense FTLE computation in $\mathbb{R}^3$.


---

### Example Usage

A typical workflow using `FTLE_2d_dense` looks like this:

```python
from ftle.flat.dense import FTLE_2d_dense

ftle_values, trajectories = FTLE_2d_dense(
    velocity_points,
    velocity_vectors,
    x_grid,
    y_grid,
    dt,
    initial_time,
    final_time,
    time_steps,
    direction,
    time_indepedent=False,
    plot_ftle=True
)
```

---

### Inputs for `FTLE_2d_dense`

- `velocity_points`: (M, 2) array of the known locations where velocity data is given.
- `velocity_vectors`: (M, 2) if time-independent or (M, 2, T) if time-dependent velocity vectors.
- `x_grid`: 2D array of X positions from `np.meshgrid`.
- `y_grid`: 2D array of Y positions from `np.meshgrid`.
- `dt`: Float, time step size for RK4 integration. Must have $0 < dt \leq 1$.
- `initial_time`: Starting time index.
- `final_time`: Ending time index.
- `time_steps`: List of available time steps.
- `direction`: String `"forward"` or `"backward"`.
- `time_indepedent`: Boolean, if True uses static velocity field.
- `plot_ftle`: Boolean, if True plots the FTLE field directly.


---

### Inputs for `FTLE_3d_dense`

Very similar to `FTLE_2d_dense` but adapted for 3D.

```python
from ftle.flat.dense import FTLE_3d_dense

ftle_values, trajectories = FTLE_3d_dense(
    velocity_points,
    velocity_vectors,
    x_grid,
    y_grid,
    z_grid,
    dt,
    initial_time,
    final_time,
    time_steps,
    direction,
    time_indepedent=False,
    plot_ftle=True
)
```

#### Inputs

- `x_grid, y_grid, z_grid`: 3D arrays from `np.meshgrid`.
- All other inputs are the same as `FTLE_2d_dense`.

---

### FTLE Computation Methodology

The FTLE computation for dense grids uses a finite difference scheme to compute the deformation gradient tensor $\partial X_f / \partial X_0$.

- For 2D: This is done in `FTLE_2d_compute`.
- For 3D: This is done in `FTLE_3d_compute`.

Both methods:

- Use central differences across the local grid.
- Build the deformation gradient $F$.
- Compute the Cauchy-Green strain tensor $C = F^T F$.
- Extract the largest eigenvalue of $C$.
- Compute FTLE as:

$$
\text{FTLE} = \frac{1}{2 |t_f - t_i|} \ln(\sqrt{\lambda_{max}})
$$

where $\lambda_{max}$ is the largest eigenvalue of $C$.

---

### Notes on Usage

- The uniform grid from `np.meshgrid` must fully cover the desired domain.
- For plotting FTLE:

```python
from ftle.flat.utilities import plot_FTLE_2d, plot_FTLE_3d
```

- The plotting functions will automatically scatter the FTLE values over the grid points.

- In 3D, the plotting shows the full 3D cloud of points and also provides 2D slices along the $XZ$ plane at select $Y$ values.

## Sparse FTLE Computations in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$

### Overview

The sparse FTLE routines are designed to work with velocity fields that are defined only at scattered locations in space. These methods do not require a grid or mesh. Instead, they interpolate the velocity field from known velocity locations and compute FTLE from particle trajectories.

Sparse FTLE computations are especially useful when:

- Your velocity field is only known at irregular points (experimental data, scattered sensors).
- You want to avoid gridding or meshing overhead.

Sparse FTLE methods rely on KD-Trees and least-squares estimation of the deformation gradient using nearest-neighbor points.

## FTLE Computation via `compute_Ftle_sparse`

The function `compute_Ftle_sparse` can be used directly if you have only the initial and final positions of particles, this works for both `d=2,3`. 

```python
from ftle.flat.sparse import compute_Ftle_sparse

ftle_values = compute_Ftle_sparse(
    initial_positions,  # (N, d)
    final_positions,    # (N, d)
    initial_time, 
    final_time, 
    k=10                # Number of nearest neighbors for FTLE computation
)
```




## Surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$

### Overview

This section provides functionality for computing FTLE (Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent) fields for flows on triangulated surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. 

This is distinct from the dense and sparse FTLE methods in Euclidean domains, as here the mesh itself evolves over time and particles are constrained to remain on the surface throughout the advection process.

The primary function for users is `FTLE_mesh`, which wraps the entire process of particle advection and FTLE computation for a triangulated, staggered mesh surface.

Additional functions such as `FTLE_compute` are available if finer control is needed (e.g. using your own advection scheme or particle data). 

---

### Example Usage

The function `FTLE_mesh` uses the input mesh data with a defined vector field data for the mesh to advect particles constrained to the mesh and to compute the FTLE values at each initial particle position. The mesh does not need any specific structure and the mesh itself can move over time and have a different number of nodes per time step. The advection scheme used is a standard RK4 scheme and KDtrees are used to assist in the projecting particles down to the surface after each time step. It is worth noting that due to the general design of `FTLE_mesh` to work with meshes that are not well defined over time(different number of nodes per time step), the RK4 integration time step is just set to $$dt=1$$(i.e the assumed difference between time steps in the mesh data). `FTLE_mesh` returns the FTLE data along with the trajectory data. Also `FTLE_mesh` has built in plotting functionality in a function `plot_FTLE_mesh` which is discussed more in a later section. 

```python
from ftle.curved.mesh import ftle_mesh

ftle_values , trajectories = def FTLE_mesh(
    node_connections,           # List[np.ndarray], each (M_t, 3)
    node_positions,             # List[np.ndarray], each (N_t, 3)
    node_velocities,            # List[np.ndarray], each (N_t, 3)
    particle_positions,         # (P, 3)
    initial_time,               # int
    final_time,                 # int
    time_steps,                 # (T,)
    direction="forward",        # "forward" or "backward"
    plot_ftle=False,            # If True, calls plot_ftle_mesh
    save_path = None,
    camera_setup = None,
    neighborhood=15,            # For FTLE computation
    lam=1e-10                   # Regularization
):
```

### Inputs for `ftle_mesh`

The `ftle_mesh` function computes the FTLE field for flows on a triangulated surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It takes the following inputs:

- `node_cons`  
  A list of arrays of shape `(M_t, 3)` for each time step. Each array describes the mesh connectivity at that time step, where `M_t` is the number of faces at time `t`.

- `node_positions`  
  A list of arrays of shape `(N_t, 3)` for each time step, where `N_t` is the number of nodes at time `t`. These are the spatial coordinates of the mesh nodes.

- `node_velocities`  
  A list of arrays of shape `(N_t, 3)` for each time step. These are the velocity vectors at each node.

- `particle_positions`  
  An array of shape `(P, 3)` containing the initial positions of the particles to advect on the surface, where `P` is the number of particles, for ease of plotting the final results it is recommended that the initial positions just correspond to the node positions at the initial time.

- `initial_time`  
  An integer specifying the starting time index for the advection. This must respect final time with respect to the `direction`('forward'/'backward') i.e if `direction` is 'backward' then `initial_time` $>$ `final_time`. Just reverse the inequality for 'forward'.

- `final_time`  
  An integer specifying the ending time index for the advection. This must respect final time with respect to the `direction`('forward'/'backward') i.e if `direction` is 'backward then `initial_time` $>$ `final_time`. Just reverse the inequality for 'forward'.

- `time_steps`  
  An array of time values corresponding to the available mesh data which should be orgainized as consecutive integers starting at 0.

- `direction`  
  A string, either `"forward"` or `"backward"` indicating the direction of advection.

- `plot_ftle`  
  Optional boolean. If `True`, automatically generates a 3D PyVista plot of the FTLE field. This does not save the plot.

- `save_path`
   Optional string. If `plot_ftle` is true then having a save path specified will save the 3d plot in that directory. Take note that if a save path is given the PyVista plotting window will not appear due to PyVista plots having to be saved off screen.

- `camera_setup`
  Optional tuple: (camera position, focal point, camera roll). 

- `neighborhood`  
  Integer (default 15). The number of nearest neighboring particles used when computing the local FTLE gradient.

- `lam`  
  Regularization parameter (default $1 \times 10^{-10}$). Helps stabilize the least-squares fit of the deformation gradient in regions with near-linear configurations.

### Inputs for `FTLE_compute`

The `FTLE_compute` function computes FTLE values directly given initial and final particle positions. It can be imported directly `from ftle.curved.mesh import FTLE_compute` This is useful if:

- You already have your own particle trajectories(like what is returned from `ftle_mesh`).

- `lam`  
  A small regularization constant (default $1 \times 10^{-10}$) used to stabilize the inversion of matrices during gradient estimation.


### Inputs for `plot_FTLE_mesh` 

The `plot_FTLE_mesh` function can be called directly by importing it `from ftle.curved.utilities import plot_FTLE_mesh`.  Here are the expected inputs:

```python

def plot_FTLE_mesh(
    node_cons,
    node_positions,
    initial_time,
    final_time,
    ftle,
    direction,
    save_path=None,           # Optional: str or None

- `final_time`  
  An integer specifying the ending time index for the advection. This must respect final time with respect to the `direction`('forward'/'backward') i.e if `direction` is 'backward then `initial_time` $>$ `final_time`. Just reverse the inequality for 'forward'.

- `camera_setup`
  Optional tuple: (camera position, focal point, camera roll). 


When no save_path is specified then you can press 'c' in the PyVista plotting window to display needed information to specifiy `camera_setup` with respect to your current camera view in the PyVista plotting window.
